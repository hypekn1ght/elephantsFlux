        <strong>Elephants Card Validity and Renewal.</strong> Unless earlier terminated or canceled, each Elephants Card is valid for a period set and shown on the Platform. Automatic renewal notices are sent via email one month before expiration if the card is used. A renewal fee, specified on the Platform, may be charged and debited from your Wallet Balance or billed separately. The same Terms apply to the renewed card. To opt out of renewal, contact the Company via support@elephants.inc or you can cancel the Elephants Card through the Platform. The Company and Issuer have the right not to issue a new Card upon the expiry of the Card’s validity or the user’s application for a new Elephants Card. If the user does not accept the Elephants Card and/or the Elephants Card is not activated within 3 months from the date of issuance of the Elephants Card, the Company or Issuer has the right to close, deactivate and destroy the Elephants Card without refunding any applicable fee and/or service charges. The user undertakes not to use the Elephants Card and not to allow the Elephants Card user to use an invalid, closed or otherwise unusable Elephants Card, and to physically destroy it within 3 days after it became closed or invalid or unusable.

        <strong>Responsibility and Liability for Card Transactions.</strong> As the user of an Elephants Card, you are fully responsible for all transactions made with the Elephants Card. This includes ensuring that it is not used for any illegal or prohibited activities as per the laws of the place where the transaction occurs or in your country of residence. You bear liability for all Card Transactions, authorized or not, whether or not executed with your knowledge, and this extends to situations involving negligence on your part. You acknowledge and accept the risks associated with unauthorized Card Transactions.

      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Confidentiality and Security of Card Data.</strong> You shall keep your Elephants Card Data strictly confidential, only sharing it as necessary for transactions. Exercise caution when providing Card Data to merchants to maintain its security. Sharing Card Data via unsecured methods, like email or fax, is not safe. Neither the Company, Issuer nor its affiliates are liable for unauthorized transactions due to your failure to secure the Card Data.
